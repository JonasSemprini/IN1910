# Project 0: Passed | 10/13 points
### If you have done the optional exercise, see the comment about this below.

## Use of git: 2/2 points
Good, but your release should be tagged with "finished" (now it is tagged with "v1.0")

## Exercise 1: 1/1 points
Good. But I am not sure why you are using an if-test in your add function here. You check if both numbers are floats, but even if the test fails you still return the exact same thing.

## Exercise 2: 1/1 points
Good.

## Exercise 3: 0.5/0.5 points
Good, but you shouldn't use "ord" as a variable name as this is already a standard function in Python.

## Exercise 4: 2/2 points
Good. Very nice that you test that you can't send negative numbers to the factorial function, but instead of just passing perhaps throwing an error with a descriptive message is better here?

And just to nitpick a little bit, for readability you should separate functions by either one or two blank lines. You can read more about proper code style for Python here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

## Exercise 5: 1.5/1.5 points
Good.

## Exercise 6: 2/2 points
Good. But to nitpick a little on style again, it's better to place the function decorators (the lines starting with @) right before the functions they belong to. That way it's easier to see immediately what functions they modify.

## Optional exercise: x/3 points
Your repository appears to be private, so I can't see if you have completed this exercise. If you have done it, please add me as a collaborator on your repository (Github user "JanOleA") and send me an e-mail so I can check it. I will edit your score if it looks alright.

You can add collaborators in the repository under `settings -> manage access.`

## Miscellaneous
Very well done! Nice docstrings and good code. There are a lot of comments above, but it's mostly nitpicking. Good job!

If you have any questions about the exercises or the feedback you are welcome to send me an email: j.o.f.akerholm@fys.uio.no
